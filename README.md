# Mn10's data repository

This is the "data/Melvin" folder, containing textures created by me or modified from ones that are not moderately copyrighted (particularly the ones in SVN).

Textures directly downloaded from here MUST be put into the corresponding subfolders inside your "data/Melvin" folder so that they can be properly loaded.

I'm not much concerned about my textures being edited for any reasons, but it would be nice if credits are given for my creations of such textures. For the textures modified from other users's files, please also (in)directly credit those people according to their copyright policies.
